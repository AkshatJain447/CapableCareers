# 🌟 Capable Careers – Bridging Talent & Opportunity for India’s Specially-Abled

**Capable Careers** is an accessible job portal and upskilling platform built for persons with disabilities in India. Conceived at SIH 2023 to combat employment barriers, the project addresses under-representation, visibility issues, and lack of resources—laying the groundwork for a more inclusive workforce.

## 🚩 The Problem

Despite progressive mandates reserving **4–5%** of government jobs for disabled individuals, less than half of these positions are filled in India. Barriers such as inaccessible information, limited resources, and community isolation keep **hundreds of thousands** of capable job seekers from meaningful work.

**Capable Careers** turns technology into access and opportunity.  
*Demo/sample data is showcased; the platform is architected to scale and impact 400,000–800,000+ specially-abled job-seekers nationwide.*
